# The partition number of the rootfs. Partition number starts at 0.

# Setup scripts #
#################

# Host side setup scripts #
# ----------------------- #

# Absolute paths to the scripts that runs in phase1 and phase 2 on the host
# that runs on the host.

# Phase 1 is generally for fetching prebuilt binaries and copying them into the
# chroot. Basically any files that cannot be put in the ROOTFS_OVERLAY should
# be generated and copied in this step.
SETUP_PHASE1_OUTSIDE_CHROOT=${curdir}/phase1-outside.sh

# Phase 2 is generally for cross compiling (such as via CMake), because the
# rootfs should already be setup with all the dependencies at this point.
# SETUP_PHASE2_OUTSIDE_CHROOT=$(pwd)/phase2-outside.sh # don't need it for this

# Chroot-side setup scripts #
# ------------------------- #

# Absolute path to the scripts that runs in phase1 and phase2 in the chroot
# that runs inside the chroot.
#
# Note: Put these scripts in the ROOTFS_OVERLAY as the copy of the overlay
# happens before these scripts fires.

# Phase 1 is generall for installing packages.
SETUP_PHASE1_INSIDE_CHROOT=/setup/phase1.sh

# Phase 2 is for removing files in the chroot that are placed to help with the
# setup of the image.
SETUP_PHASE2_INSIDE_CHROOT=/setup/phase2.sh

# Path to qemu-user-static on the host, which will be copied into the chroot to
# the same path.

# Override functions #
######################
#
# Some functions needs to be overwritten, such as how to extract and
# verify the images, custom verification before build starts, etc.

#
# Verification can be optionally performed, such as with sha256sum.
